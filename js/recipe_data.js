      "The neep (aka swede) is a classic Scottish ingredient most commonly associated with _haggis neeps and tatties_, the national dish. For this famous dish it's usually blended or crushed to a pulp with butter – much the same as one would make mashed potato – and it's really nice like this; the butter compliments the sweetness of the neeps, which are surprisingly sweet when cooked. I do, however, think it's underrated as an ingredient to be used in many other ways.",
      "Restaurant Mark Greenaway, one of the places I worked, used to serve _confit neeps_. The neeps were cut into chunky oblongs and then slowly cooked in clarified butter. They were served simply with a fillet of hake topped with a herb crust. My version of hake-with-neeps is an improvement on Mark's version, I think, because I sauteed the confit neeps before serving, to bring some vital caramelisation to the party. Combined with the crunchy skin of the pan fried hake, I think you'll agree it's pretty excellent!",
      "As for the sauce, brown butter (beurre noisette) is an easy option for any kind of fish, and something I often turn to. It ended up being almost a _sauce grenobloise_ after I added chopped lemon and capers. I finished the garnish with some cavolo nero and brown shrimp."

Carefully pour of the fat into another pan, and discard the milky bit. Peel the neep and cut into chunky oblongs about 2cm thick. Immerse them in the clarified butter and place over a medium-low heat. Cook gently; don't allow the butter to get too hot otherwise the neeps will start to fry. Cook for about 20-30 minutes or until they are tender, then remove from the pan and allow to cool. Once cool, cut the oblongs into dice.",

Stir-and-fry for about 30 seconds, then add about half a glassful of water and put a lid on (use a piece of foil if you don't have a lid). Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until tender. Set aside.",
      "Now for the fish: place a heavy-based frying pan over a high heat and allow to get hot. Add 2 tablespoons of oil. Wait for the oil to get hot; about 30 seconds. Season the fish all over with salt, then place in the pan, skin side down. Press gently to ensure the skin makes good contact with the surface of the pan. Keep the heat high for 30 seconds, then turn down to medium. Cook like this for about 3 minutes. You should be able to see that the flesh of the fish is about 3/4 cooked. At thisd point, add the 60g of reserved butter from earlier, and allow it to foam. Baste the fish for 1 minute. The fish should be cooked at this point. You can check if it's cooked by inserting a skewer: it should give no resistance. Remove the fish and set aside.",
      "While the fish is cooking, fry the diced neep in a hot pan until caramelised, then set aside.",
      "To finish the sauce, add the capers, lemons and brown shrimp. To serve, place the cavolo nero in the centre of the plate and put the neeps on top, followed by the sauce."

      "For me tomatoes are the highlight of summer. They are best, at their sweetest and juiciest, during the peak of the season, from June through to August. Panzanella is an old-school Italian peasant dish, making a spectacular combination of leftover scraps of stale bread and fresh, ripe tomatoes. Although probably classed as a salad, this amazing plate of food is, for me, often a meal in its own right.",
      "The quality of bread is important; you want a crusty sourdough with big air pockets. Tear it into bite-sized chunks and leave them uncovered to go stale for a few days. They should be as hard as possible. The rest of the dish is based around a simple dressing made from the juice of the tomatoes: cut them into chunky pieces, season with sea salt and leave in a colander for 20 minutes. Squeezing them out with your hands releases the juices and you simply add vinegar and extra virgin olive oil to make a sharp, powerful dressing. The stale bread is then added to this to soak up all the flavour. It's amazing."

      "The risotto remains one of my regular weeknight meals. It's quick to prepare and, to make a plain _risotto bianco_, requires only a few basic ingredients. It's what I call a 'store cupboard' meal, meaning that the ingredients it comprises all keep for a long time, either in the fridge or the cupboard, so you can always keep them in stock, waiting to be made into a delicious risotto at a moment's notice.",
      "My [winter risotto](https://www.grubdaily.com/risotto-winter-greens) was essentially just a plain risotto with some cavolo nero added. I've taken a similar approach here, but with peas, to keep it seasonal. I've added some crisp bacon lardons for good measure. The salty savouriness of the bacon compliments the sweet peas perfectly and it provides a lovely colour contrast, too."

Immediately turn down the heat and cook slowly for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and sweet. This is the _soffrito_.",
      "Now turn the heat to high and add the rice. Stir vigorously for about 30 seconds to coat the rice in the flavour of the soffrito, then add the wine. Turn the heat to medium-high and continue to stir until all the liquid has gone. From this point the risotto will take about 15 minutes.Continue to add the chicken stock, 1 ladleful at  time, stirring continuously to massage and coax the starch from the rice. This creates the thick sauce of the risotto.",
      "After about 15 minutes, the risotto should be ready. When you taste a grain of rice, there should be a _slight_ bite to it. If it's still quite hard, continue cooking for a bit longer. Turn the heat off, then add the chilled butter and parmesan gradually, whilst beating the risotto to emulsify it into a lovely creamy texture. If it seems too thick, add a bit of stock. As Giorgio Locatelli says 'It should ripple like waves on the sea'. If you run out of stock, just use boiling water.",
      "At this point, add half of the peas to the risotto and stir through. Portion the risotto into bowls and garnish with the remaining peas and lardons. Finish with some parmesan shavings."

Just like it’s more glamorous relative the mussel, the cockle contains an abundance of naturally salty juices which are released into your saucepan when cooked. Enhanced with a little white wine, shallots and some aromatics like thyme or bay, the result is fantastically flavoursome, and served with some chips to dunk in the sauce, is a fine meal in itself.",
      "Cockles are also a lovey accompaniment to fish. For this meal, I’ve reduced the liquor from the cockles by half, then added an equal quantity of double cream before reducing further to a fairly light but richly flavoured sauce. I’ve finished it with a nice chiffonade of parsley. The rest of the meal is pretty straight forward; crisp pan-fried cod fillets, and some crushed potatoes with spinach. Wonderful."

When the fillets are about two-thirds cooked, add the butter and allow it to foam, then squeeze in the lemon juice. Baste the fillets for about 1 minute until almost cooked, then flip them over, being careful not to break the skin. By this time the butter should have turned a nutty brown colour. Turn the heat off and leave in the pan for 30 seconds.",

I could probably use them in about two weeks by eating them in various guises for breakfast, lunch _and_ dinner, but it would feel like a bit of a waste... I would like to extend the joy of eating these delicious mushrooms for as long as possible.",

Drying was an obvious one: I oven-dried most of the scruffy ones and made powder from them; an intensely flavoured seasoning that's worth its weight in gold. Pickling is a popular method for preserving various vegetables, but it's not commonly applied to mushrooms. I gave it a go, and the result was pretty good. I didn't add salt to the pickling liquid as I feared it would break down the flesh of the mushroom too much, so the final product requires a sprinkling of sea salt to bring out the flavour properly.",

You could even incorporate them into a salad. There are many possibilities. I advise using girolles for this, if you can source them, but it would work just as well with button mushrooms or chestnut mushrooms from the supermarket."

      "While this lockdown is still in place I'm working on the theme of tinned fish. Previously, I pointed out how well mackerel works as a preserved, tinned product. Part of the reason for this is that it's a particularly oily fish and it doesn't tend to be dry when cooked. It's also one of the most abundant fish in the ocean – especially around the british isles – so it's sustainable. Another fish which ticks these boxes is anchovies. Anchovies are one of the most abundant fish in the entire world. For sustainability points, they are hard to beat. They are also, of course, really really tasty.",

      "This is a great way to cook a chicken leg that gets the best out of the skin by exploiting its crispy crunchy potential. I'm sure most of you will agree when I say the best part of a chicken is the crispy skin! The secret here is to lightly cure the chicken skin by sprinkling rock salt on it and leaving for about 8 hours. This draws moisture out of the skin, meaning that it goes amazingly crispy when you fry it, much the same as a confit duck leg. I make a simple spice rub with some olive oil, garlic and paprika and rub this into the flesh side. The result is amazing!",

Take one of the cloves of garlic and crush it to a paste. Place in a small bowl with 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika. Mix to a thick paste, then add a generous pinch of sea salt and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Mix well, then rub into the flesh side of the chicken legs. Place the legs on a plate, flesh side down, then sprinkle the rock salt evenly onto the skin side. Place in the fridge for 8 hours or overnight. Place the butter beans in a bowl and generously cover with cold water. Leave to soak, also for 8 hours or overnight.",
      "For the butter bean stew, place a large heavy based pan or casserole dish over a medium/high heat and add a couple of glugs of olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the lardons and fry until lightly caramelised, then add the diced carrots along with a pinch of salt. Continue to fry over a medium/high heat until the carrots are beginning to colour. Turn the heat down to low and add the onion and garlic. Cook gently, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. The onion should be nice and soft and starting to turn sweet. Drain the butter beans thoroughly and add to the pot with the vegetables, along with the chicken stock, the remaining 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika and the worcester sauce. Bring to the boil, then turn to a gentle simmer for about 1 hour, or until the beans are tender but not falling apart. They may take longer depending on how dry/old the beans are.",
      "For the chicken, it's a good idea to remove it from the fridge to wash the salt off and dry it about 30 minutes before you cook it. This will ensure the skin is really dry and ready to go, and it'll also bring the meat up to temperature a bit, allowing for more even cooking. Wash the salt from the skin side of the chicken under a running tap, being careful not to wash off the paprika on the other side. Take some kitchen paper and pat the skin as dry as you can get it.",
      "Get a large heavy based frying pan or skillet and place it over a high heat. Add 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil and when it's hot, add the chicken, skin side down. Don't overcrowd the pan; if it's too small, do it in batches. Press the chicken gently to ensure the skin is lying flat, and cook like this for about 20 seconds. Now turn the heat to medium/low. Cook for about 5 minutes like this, ensuring that the heat isn't too high. You want the skin crispy, but not black! When you can see that the flesh side is about half cooked from beneath, flip the chicken and turn the heat right down. Cook for another 4 or 5 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.",
      "Finish the butter bean stew by adding the balsamic vinegar and diced chorizo and stir through. To serve, put a couple of ladlefuls of the stew into each bowl, then carve the chicken into strips. Divide between the bowls, and garnish with the basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."

      "Lamb chops are great, but admittedly they're not my favourite cut of lamb. Each lamb chop consists of a cutlet from the loin attached to its corresponding rib bone, usually with a gorgeous thick slab of back fat along the bone. It's _bovine_ equivalent is the celebrated and iconic beef rib roast. The loin, regardless of which animal it's from, is one of the tenderest and most prized cuts of meat around and I think it's a bit of a shame to prepare a loin of lamb as chops because they're hard to cook; you have to roast them with enough ferocity to get the fat nice and crisp without overcooking the meat. Because there's usually a large amount of fat this is virtually impossible. In my opinion, you'd be better to ask your butcher for a full rack of chops (cutlets) to roast whole or even take the loin completely off the bone before roasting like a steak. Both of these methods allow you to keep the meat nice and pink, which is how it is supposed to be.",
      "To avoid this difficult situation I deboned the chops and left the meat as medallion-sized chunks. The fat, which is full of flavour and a _key_ part of this dish, I diced into 1cm chunks. I seasoned everything with crunchy sea salt and a little sprinkling of white pepper before searing in a very hot pan. The rest of the dish comprised some chunky croutons, made from my numerous leftover sourdough loaves, sauteed spinach and some anchovy fillets. Seasoned generously with cracked black pepper, sea salt and a splash of tarragon vinegar, it was very, very good."

      "This is another one for all the peanut butter lovers out there, and in fact I’d be willing to bet that even peanut butter haters will enjoy this dessert. There’s something about the flavour and texture of peanut butter that makes it quite uncompromising; for some, the richness is too much on its own, and is only palatable when paired with something sweet. In the contest to be the most loved peanut butter dish, the old-school favourite _peanut butter and jam_ is arguably winning. I would, however, argue that this cheesecake beats it hands-down.",
      "Broadly speaking, there are two classes of cheesecake: baked, and unbaked. This one falls into the latter (slightly quicker and easier) option. The general technique for the filling is very simple; make a thick puree (peanut caramel in this case, although strawberry, raspberry or chocolate also work well), and mix in cream cheese. Now simply soft-peak-whip some cream and gently fold in.",
      "This cheesecake is mousse-like in texture and rich in taste. The biscuit base provides a nice contrast to the creamy-cheesy peanut mix that sits atop. Traditionally, Digestive biscuits have been used for a cheesecake base, but why use Digestives when you could use Hobnobs instead? After all, they taste better and it’s what [Delia](https://www.deliaonline.com/) would do."

      "Dal is the Indian name given to lentils or beans. In India you can find a huge variety, and many more delicious savory concoctions made from them. When I visited the country, I was astounded at the depth of flavour that could be found in  a _dal_; they were undeniably tasty, and had a powerful savoriness that I had previously thought wasn't possible in a dish with no meat.",
      "As lentils and beans are relatively inexpensive, they are used in everyday meals for lunch and dinner. This dal, made from black _urid beans_ however, is a bit more special. Due to the toughness of these beans, they must be soaked for several hours, then slowly simmered over a gentle heat for several hours more. Of course, a customary mixture of garlic, onion and spices is added to the mixture, and the result is a dark earthy bean stew that has a hint of smokiness. It's very rich, there's no denying it, so I have finished it with a swirl of yoghurt and some freshly chopped coriander."

      "A while ago I decided to try my hand at cheesemaking - as a devoted lover of cheese I think it was inevitable that I would try to make my own sooner or later. The obvious starting point for any amateur cheesemaker is ricotta. It's the simplest of cheeses - simply add something acidic, such as lemon juice, to some milk to split it into its constituent parts, and drain. Season the resulting drained curds with some sea salt and you're done; it's that easy. The nice thing about ricotta is that it's typically made with either lemon juice or vinegar, rather than rennet like most other cheeses, so you don't need any specialist ingredients.",
      "This dish was inspired by a recipe for a Corsican/Italian dish called _strozapretti_, which consists of rustic ricotta dumplings loaded with chopped fresh herbs and chard. It's like ravioli but without the pasta. Normally, the dumplings would be fairly rough and imperfect in shape, but I have shaped mine nicely into rounds. I've also baked them in the oven until golden, which is great with the grated parmesan on top.  Baked in a rich tomato sauce, it's pretty irresistible!",
      "The ricotta for this recipe should be quite firm, which is easy to achieve if you make your own. Click [here](https://www.grubdaily.com/ricotta) for my own ricotta recipe. Alternatively, you can use shop-bought ricotta and drain it overnight in a fine sieve."

      "When I mention fish soup to my friends they typically turn up their noses. I think the first thing that comes to their minds is some kind of unappetising greyish slop, but this one is about as far from that image as you could get! This recipe has its roots in Provence, in the south of France. It's a two-day affair; first you have to diligently clean the fish and rinse them under running water before marinating overnight in olive oil, a selection of herbs and spices, and a _mire poix_ of vegetables. This marinating really makes a difference to the depth of flavour - I recommend you don't omit this step. The spices (saffron and paprika) give the soup an inviting golden colour.",
      "In the restaurant we would order 'fish soup mix' from our fishmonger and they would provide us with a nice range of small fish such as gurnard, mullet, hake or john dory. They were too small to be worth selling on their own as there would be hardly any meat on them, but they were perfect for soup. Luckily I live only a ten minute walk from the harbour, and there is a fishmonger right there on the waterfront. Unfortunately they didn't have any fish-soup-sized fish in stock, so I took one small sea bream and one small sea bass instead.",
      "For extra savory punch I begin the soup by frying anchovies to create a sticky, salty base. While the fish are roasting in the oven I add the vegetables to the pan and cook them down until soft and sweet. I also add a tin of cooked sardines. The oily fish gives an extra richness. The amazing thing about this soup is everything is pureed, bones included, to create quite a thick, substantial meal. It's perfect served with black olive tapenade on toast. It really is an amazing dish and I promise that you'll see fish soup in a different light after eating this!"

      "Heat the oven to 200C. Carefully separate the vegetables from the fish. Place the fish in a roasting tray and roast in the oven for 30-40 minute, or until golden. Meanwhile, place a large, heavy-based pot or casserole dish over a medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Wait 1 minute for the oil to heat up, then add the anchovies plus about a tablespoon of the oil from the tin. Stir-and-fry until the anchovies have broken down into a nice sticky paste, then add the rest of the vegetables. Add another pinch of salt, then cook over a medium heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are soft and sweet and starting to caramelise.",
      "At this point, the fish should be ready. Add the roasted pieces to the pot with the vegetables, and drain the tin of sardines and add that too. Mix well, then cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, skimming and froth that rises to the surface. Once boiling, turn down to a gentle simmer and cook like this for 1.5 hours, topping up with water to keep the ingredients _just_ covered. The bones of the fish should be very soft and almost mushy.",
      "Blend the soup, in batches if need be, and pass through a fine sieve. It's very important to use a _fine mesh_ sieve here as you don't want any of the coarse stuff in the soup."
