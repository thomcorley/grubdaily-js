      "200g cavolo nero","30g parmesan cheese, finely grated","1 clove of garlic, peeled and finely sliced","1 handful pine nuts","1 handful cashew nuts","1 handful pistachio nuts","1 stick celery, peeled","3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil","2 teaspoons tarragon vinegar","sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper","vegetable oil, for frying"],"recipeInstructions":["Heat the oven to 200C and place a roasting tray inside to get hot. Remove and discard the tough inner stalks from the cavolo nero, then roughly chop the leaves into 2-3 inch long pieces. Once the roasting tray is hot, place one third of the cavolo nero in the tray and toss with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Season lightly with sea salt and place in the oven for 10 minutes.","From the remainder of the cavolo nero, take a small handful and finely chop. Set this aside - it will go in the salad, raw, at the end.","Take a frying pan or saute pan and place it over a medium heat. Add a little vegetable oil and, once it's hot, add the remaining cavolo nero and season lightly with sea salt. Stir and fry for 30 seconds, then add the sliced garlic. Continue to fry for 30 more seconds then add a glassful of water. Cover with a lid or some kitchen foil and steam until the cavolo nero is tender.","Check the cavolo nero in the oven. You want it to be crisp. If it's not quite there then give it a toss and return to the oven for 5 minutes. When it's done, remove from the tray and place on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain.","Put the steamed cavolo nero in a mixing bowl and allow to cool. Roughly chop the cashews and pistachios to be about the same size at the pine nuts, then place in a pan over a medium-high heat and add a small pinch of salt. Dry roast until lightly golden, then add to the mixing bowl. Finely slice the celery at an angle and add to the bowl along with the raw cavolo nero you set aside earlier. Add most of the parmesan, saving about a quarter of it to put on top at the end. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the tarragon vinegar, then mix everything together. Taste and season with salt and pepper if necessary. It might need more olive oil and/or vinegar, too. Serve in a bowl, with the crisp cavolo nero and the reserved parmesan on the top."]},

      "450g strong white flour","350g sourdough starter","220g tepid water","1 tsp dried yeast","3 tbsp fine quality rapeseed oil","13g salt"],"recipeInstructions":["Pour the sourdough starter into a large bowl. Add the flour, salt and yeast on top, and mix briefly without disturbing the sourdough underneath.","Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture, and add the water and rapeseed oil. Using a sturdy wooden spoon, mix everything together thoroughly until you have a wet, sticky dough. Continue to mix for about 5 minutes. The dough should have become slightly elastic. Cover lightly with a cloth or cling film, and leave in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.","Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and pat into an approximate rectangular shape. Take the two right hand corners, stretch them outwards, then fold back in to opposite corners. Repeat this with the left side, then turn the dough over, pat into a rectangle again and repeat once more. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover and leave _in the fridge_ overnight.","In the morning, repeat the folding and stretching process from Step 3, then cover and place back in the fridge for about 8 hours.","Turn the oven to 220C and put in your baking tray to get it nice and hot. Also place your roasting tray in the bottom to catch the water and create the steam. Dust your baker's linen or a thick kitchen cloth with flour, and place on a large chopping board or tray. Take the dough from the fridge and microwave at full power for 20 seconds. Scrape the dough onto a floured surface, place back in the bowl the other way up and give it another 20 seconds. The dough will now be warmed through, and rising nicely. There should be some visible air pockets forming. If you don't want to microwave it, simply leave it to come up to room temperature for about 2 hours.","Turn onto a floured surface and pat into a wide baguette shape about 30cm x 15cm. Cut it in half lengthways to create two thinner baguettes, and place each on the floured cloth, creating a fold in the centre to separate them, and something to weigh the edges down to stop the dough from spreading out. Boil a mugful of water in the kettle.","Once the oven is up to temperature, place each of the baguettes onto the tray. You'll find this easier if you can find a thin \"transfer\" spatula or paddle. A piece of thick cardboard would suffice. Using a sharp knife, score the baguettes across at an angle several times, then dust with a little flour. Place in the oven, then throw the mug of boiling water into the tray at the bottom and immediately close the door. Bake for 25 minutes, then turn around and give another 5 minutes. The loaves should be hollow when tapped underneath. Place on a wire rack to cool."]},

Gently squeeze the cabbage with your hands to remove the excess water, then leave to drain.","Make the spice paste: Finely grate the garlic and place in a bowl along with the ginger, sugar, fish sauce, chilli flakes. Mix until you have a smooth paste. Mix the cabbage with the spice paste and massage with your fingertips again (use gloves if you're bothered about your hands getting stained and smelly!).","Sterilise the jars: you can do this by washing them in hot soapy water, then rinse, and, without drying, put straight into an oven at 180C for 20 minutes. Alternatively, just put them through the dishwasher.","Pack the kimchi into jars and press down until some liquid rises to the top to cover the kimchi, and leave 2cm of space at the top of the jar. If it's too dry, transfer the kimchi back to the bowl, mix in some of the salty water and put back into the jar.","Leave at room temperature for 2 - 5 days, depending on how much fermentation you want. The warmer it is, the faster the fermentation will be. I'd advise 5 days for a really strong savoury flavour. You should place the jars on a tray as some liquid will likely seep out. Open up the jars every 24 hours to allow the gases to escape. Once you have achieved your desired level of fermentation, put the jars into the fridge. The kimchi will continue to mature and will be best after a week or two but you can eat it immediately if you're too impatient!"]},

Cook gently for 2 minutes, being careful not to burn the garlic, then remove from the heat and set aside.","Add the spaghetti to the boiling water and cook for _2 minutes less_ than it says on the packet's instructions. This is because after draining the pasta we're going to heat it again as we make the sauce, so it'll continue to cook.","While the pasta is cooking, start to prepare for the sauce; place the eggs into a jug or bowl and add most of the finely grated parmesan (leaving some for garnish at the end), along with a small pinch of sea salt.","When the pasta is about 2 minutes away, drain it over another jug or bowl, making sure you reserve about 200ml of water. Whisk the eggs and cheese together to make a thick paste, then pour about 4-5 tablespoons of the pasta water in, while still whisking. Now add the pancetta and garlic, pasta and egg mixture back into the pasta pan and place over a medium-low heat. Add about 100ml more of the pasta water and, using a plastic spatula, stir continuously, scraping the bottom of the pan until it's the texture of custard. Be very careful not to overheat it as the eggs will scramble. If it gets too thick, add a little more water - you should have a nice sauce consistency that just clings to the pasta.","Divide into pasta bowls, garnish with the remaining parmesan and eat immediately."]},

Place the purple potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water.. Season with a generous pinch of salt and place over a medium-high heat. Bring to boil then turn down the heat and simmer gently for around 20 minutes or until they're tender. Remove from the heat and leave to cool in the water.","Before you begin cooking the mushrooms, wait for the potatoes to finish cooking because you're going to need the purple starchy water for the ragout. Cut the mushrooms into halves or quarters so you have pieces approximately the same size. Leave the smallest ones whole. Heat a saute pan over a medium heat and add about a teaspoon of the butter. Heat until the butter is foaming then add the mushrooms along with a pinch of salt. Toss or stir-and-fry over the heat for about a minute then add a couple of ladlefuls of the potato water, until the mushrooms are half-submerged. Partially cover with either a lid or a piece of foil, and simmer until the mushrooms are cooked; probably around 4-5 minutes. Drain in a colander when they're done, being sure to reserve the liquid.","Place the cavolo nero into the same saute pan with a glug of extra virgin olive oil and place over a medium heat. Add a pinch of salt and saute gently for 30 seconds. Add about 200ml of water and bring to the boil. Partially cover with a lid or a piece of foil and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain in a colander.","Cut the potatoes in halves or quarters to make bite-sized pieces. To finish, add the mushrooms, cavolo nero and potatoes to the same saute pan and add a ladleful of the potato cooking water. Bring to the boil then add the butter, a little at a time, until the sauce starts to thicken and becomes glossy. If it's too thick then add a little more of the starchy cooking water. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.","Take two pieces of baking parchment that are approximately the same size as the fillets of hake. Season the fillets of hake on both sides with sea salt and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place on the parchment, skin-side (the smoother side which had the skin on it before it was removed) up. Place in the steamer and cook for 3-4 minutes, depending on size, until just cooked through. The easiest way to check if the fish is cooked is to insert a small skewer or needle into the flesh: it's cooked if it passes through with virtually no resistance. Serve the mushroom ragout in bowls and place the steamed fish on top, finishing with a glug of extra virgin olive oil."]},

Using a sharp boning knife, carefully remove the bones without breaking the skin. Also remove any gristle or sinew. Make a marinade with half of the paprika, half of the garlic and all of the extra virgin olive oil. It should be like a paste: add more paprika if it's too thin.

Dry the skin thoroughly, then set aside.","To cook the potatoes: put them in a pot, add a generous pinch of salt and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, then simmer very gently for about 15-20 minutes or until they are tender. Meanwhile, make the _persillade:_ take half of the parsley leaves and finely chop them. Finely chop the rest of the garlic too, and mix with the finely chopped parsley.

Stir and fry until there are no more bubbles coming from them – this means the water content is almost zero and they will be crisp. Drain in a colander first, then a plate lined with kitchen paper to remove the excess oil. Sprinkle with a little sea salt.","When the potatoes are a few minutes away from ready, cook the mushrooms: heat the butter in a frying pan, and when it is foaming, add the mushrooms. Cook until they are tender, then remove from the heat and set aside while you cook the chicken.","For cooking the chicken: heat a large, heavy-based pan or skillet over a high heat. The pan should be big enough to easily fit in both of the deboned chicken legs. Add about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and wait until it is hot (about 30 seconds), and then add the chicken, skin-side down. Press the chicken flat against the surface of the pan to ensure even contact, then turn the heat down to medium-high. Season the marinaded side of the chicken lightly with sea salt. Cook until the skin side is very golden and crisp, and the marinated side is about three-quarters cooked, then flip over and finish cooking on the marinated side for a few minutes. At this point, add the potatoes and persillade to the pan you cooked the mushrooms in and fry gently over a medium heat to cook out the garlic.","When the chicken is ready, carve it into strips. Serve on top of the potatoes and mushrooms, with a dollop of creme fraiche on the side, finally garnishing with a sprinkle of paprika and the crisp parsley leaves."]},

    "recipeIngredient":[
      "2 large chicken legs, bones removed","1 tbsp coarse rock salt","1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus more for frying","2 tsp smoked paprika","200g dried butter beans","2 medium carrots, diced","50g pancetta, cut into chunky lardons","1 small onion, diced","3 cloves garlic, chopped","2 tsp worcester sauce","500ml chicken stock","2 tsp balsamic vinegar","2 tsp smoked paprika","50g chorizo, diced","1 bunch basil, leaves picked","sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper","vegetable oil, for frying"],"recipeInstructions":["Take the boned out chicken legs and score the flesh side several times. This will allow the flavour of the spice rub to penetrate effectively. Take one of the cloves of garlic and crush it to a paste. Place in a small bowl with 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika. Mix to a thick paste, then add a generous pinch of sea salt and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Mix well, then rub into the flesh side of the chicken legs. Place the legs on a plate, flesh side down, then sprinkle the rock salt evenly onto the skin side. Place in the fridge for 8 hours or overnight. Place the butter beans in a bowl and generously cover with cold water. Leave to soak, also for 8 hours or overnight.","For the butter bean stew, place a large heavy based pan or casserole dish over a medium/high heat and add a couple of glugs of olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the lardons and fry until lightly caramelised, then add the diced carrots along with a pinch of salt. Continue to fry over a medium/high heat until the carrots are beginning to colour. Turn the heat down to low and add the onion and garlic. Cook gently, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. The onion should be nice and soft and starting to turn sweet. Drain the butter beans thoroughly and add to the pot with the vegetables, along with the chicken stock, the remaining 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika and the worcester sauce. Bring to the boil, then turn to a gentle simmer for about 1 hour, or until the beans are tender but not falling apart. They may take longer depending on how dry/old the beans are.","For the chicken, it's a good idea to remove it from the fridge to wash the salt off and dry it about 30 minutes before you cook it. This will ensure the skin is really dry and ready to go, and it'll also bring the meat up to temperature a bit, allowing for more even cooking. Wash the salt from the skin side of the chicken under a running tap, being careful not to wash off the paprika on the other side. Take some kitchen paper and pat the skin as dry as you can get it.","Get a large heavy based frying pan or skillet and place it over a high heat. Add 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil and when it's hot, add the chicken, skin side down. Don't overcrowd the pan; if it's too small, do it in batches. Press the chicken gently to ensure the skin is lying flat, and cook like this for about 20 seconds. Now turn the heat to medium/low. Cook for about 5 minutes like this, ensuring that the heat isn't too high. You want the skin crispy, but not black! When you can see that the flesh side is about half cooked from beneath, flip the chicken and turn the heat right down. Cook for another 4 or 5 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.","Finish the butter bean stew by adding the balsamic vinegar and diced chorizo and stir through. To serve, put a couple of ladlefuls of the stew into each bowl, then carve the chicken into strips. Divide between the bowls, and garnish with the basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."]
